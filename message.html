                        As an Education Foundation, we have many successful records as good education provider which
                        are highlighted in our website. We have seen our self growing from last 5 years. With every
                        passing year, we found the new opportunity to serve the people in need. With the experience of
                        executing many successful education projects and the goodwill we have gained, we are gearing
                        towards another year of challenge to implement the education far better than last year. We are
                        encouraged to work more as a best education provider. Indeed, Education Foundation Nepal has
                        gained this height only due to the dedication of its staff member for the humanitarian cause
                        even in the very hard time. On behalf of Education Foundation Nepal, I would like to extend our
